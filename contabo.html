            You can use the Contabo API to create and manage all aspects of Object Storage. We use S3-compatible format and protocol for API calls connected to objects and buckets. You can also manage basic aspects through Contabo CLI. It is also possible to use AWS S3 CLI with Contabo Object Storage.
